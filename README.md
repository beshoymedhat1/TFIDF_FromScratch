# TFIDF_FromScratch

## • Data: 
you should search for function to generate a document if it gets any phrase Generate more than one document in different fields.
in this stage we used llm to generate 3 documents

## • Processing on data:
1. Cleaning data from each symbol or character doesn’t contain to the data.

4. Lemmatization or Stemming: return each word to origin.
5. Stop words: remove stop words from the data.

## • Unique words:
- Get the unique words from the data.

## • TFIDF:
the output of the assignment gets feature vector for each document.
1. Get TF for each word for all documents.
2. Get IDF for each word.
3. Multiply TF * IDF
4. Get Normalized TFIDF
